/*
 * ModeController.java
 *
 * We will talk about the concept of a Player Mode the first few weeks
 * of class. A player mode is often like a self-contained game in
 * its own right. Therefore, it should have its own root (sub)controller.
 * Since the game will often switch back and forth between player modes
 * we would like the modes to have a uniform interface.  That way they
 * can all be handled the same by the true root controller, GDXRoot.
